# Kopf-Free

This project is an exercice of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
It's about a coffee brand I created, out of my imagination who will help people to have less migraines and more excitment and love in life. People often see coffee as a bad thing because of its capacity of increasing heart rates and therefore many myths resulted from it.

As Someone who loves coffee, I wanted to give an idea about a coffee made with special ingredients that can help people without having bad consequences from it. Because we, as humans, tend to ignore scientifical arguments and believe everything that's advertised on the web. 

I hope my creativity has made people like the concept, and maybe we'll have some kind of coffee in the future!
